They must win turn-based battles, uncover ancient secrets, and manage their fuel supplies to ensure they arrive in time to thwart the evil plans of their merciless enemies.\nEvery expedition is different in Pathway. This is because, in addition to a basic outline, expeditions are always assigned a random series of new events. But even events that you may have encountered before can take an unexpected turn, either through chance or because of the different composition of your team.\n[p][h1]Persistent gameplay[/h1]Even a defeat means progress in Pathway, as characters gain experience even when they fail. Over the course of individual adventures, characters will gain enough experience and equipment to attempt increasingly risky undertakings.\nManage your expedition! Make use of the strengths of its individual members! Make the right decisions on the events you experience during your journey!\n[p][h1]Every decision counts[/h1]The world is on the brink of disaster as an undeclared war rages in the shadows! Victory or defeat – only you and your unsung heroes can decide the outcome!\n[p][img:codex_armor]"

For ranged combat targets behind high and low cover, the hit probability is calculated using a formula that takes into account the type of cover, the accuracy of the weapon and the dexterity of the shooter. Attacks from adjacent tiles cancel out the protective effects of cover.

She, and all units positioned to the north would have a clear shot.\nGeorgette (left, kneeling) is positioned to the south of the soldier, but she is also in a directly adjacent tile, thereby negating the protective effects of his cover."
